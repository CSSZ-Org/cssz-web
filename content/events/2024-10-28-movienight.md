### Movie Night: Adéla ještě nevečeřela

Join us in celebrating the founding of Czechoslovakia on October 28 with a special movie night!

We'll be screening the classic Czechoslovak comedy Adéla ještě nevečeřela (Dinner for Adele) from 1977. This beloved film is a playful parody of detective stories, featuring an intrepid investigator and a wildly eccentric adversary.

Blending humor, absurdity, and a nod to classic detective tropes, Dinner for Adele became a cult favorite and even won the 1980 Saturn Award for Best Foreign Film.

Popcorn and drinks will be provided.

**The movie starts at 19:15.**

Come laugh with us and enjoy this cinematic gem!
