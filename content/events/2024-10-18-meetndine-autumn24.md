### Meet'n'Dine: Goulash!

Join us for an exciting cultural dinner at the University of Zurich on **October 18, 2024**, from **18:30 to 22:00**. This is a wonderful opportunity to connect with fellow students while indulging in the rich flavors of **Goulash**, a hearty dish with deep roots in Central European cuisine.

Goulash is a flavorful stew made from tender cuts of meat, seasoned with a blend of spices, including paprika, and often accompanied by vegetables like potatoes and carrots.
