CSSZ invites you a big liquor tasting event.
Members of the association as well as non-members are equally welcome to join.
We'll be tasting a variety of Czech and Slovak liquor specialties, including Slivovice, Boroviƒçka, and more.

This event is organised in collaboration with the ESN Z√ºrich.
We expect around **80 participants**.


## Entrance fee

- **Free** if you bring liquor (read below), or
- **20 CHF** if paid by bank in advance (read below), or
- **23 CHF** if paid at the door by Twint or cash.

The entry entitles you to **unlimited** tasting: drink as much as you want. Some snacks will be provided, too.

Due to the nature of the event, only people over 18 years of age are permitted entry.


### Bring liquor, get in for free

We will need a lot of help putting together the alcohol.
If you bring some bottles of liquor from Czechia or Slovakia, apart from being treated a big hero, you will also get in for free.

- Purchase traditional beer, wine, or spirits that you would like to drink in Czechia or Slovakia, either in stores or at the airport, and _keep the receipt_.

  See the following table for a list of bottles that we are missing, or contact the organisers to coordinate your purchase.

  See [this page](https://www.bazg.admin.ch/bazg/en/home/information-individuals/travel-and-purchases--allowances-and-duty-free-limit/importation-into-switzerland/duty-free-allowances--foodstuffs--alcohol-and-tobacco.html) for the duty-free limits.

- Please submit [this form](https://forms.gle/NYgqJGtc8zMahcJVA) with the list of bottles you are bringing (this will help planning).
- Bring the bottles on one of the following days:
  - **Monday 4 March** between 15:00 and 16:00 next to CAB 55.3 (preferred)
  - **Wednesday 6 March** between 13:00 and 14:00 next to CAB 55.3

  We will collect the receipt and reimburse you the full price of the alcohol by Twint.
- If you are bringing at least 4 liters of alcohol, you will get in for free. Otherwise, you will get a discount of 5 CHF per delivered liter, which you can apply by purchasing the ticket when delivering the bottles.

You will be put on a guest list, so you don't need to purchase a ticket at the door when you present a photo ID.


### Pay in advance

_(details to be provided soon)_

- 'Your Name' on the payment reference must match the person who will attend the event.
- In case of a payment on behalf of multiple people, please send multiple payments with different references.
- If your payment arrives after 04.03.2024, you will need to pay the difference of 3 CHF at the door.
  (this helps us for event planning)


### Pay at the door

You can pay at the door by Twint or cash (no change provided).
