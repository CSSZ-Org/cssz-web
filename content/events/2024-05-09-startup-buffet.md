## About the Event

Are you interested in startups and things around them?

The Czech and Slovak Students in Zurich society in collaboration with Prague-based VC fund KAYA will be co-organising a buffet dinner in ETH Alumni, at 6pm on the 9th of May.

You can look forward to meeting representatives from KAYA (and their portfolio) who will be happy to answer your questions, network with like-minded people and of course have some good food. This could be particularly interesting if you are thinking about starting a startup, but anyone with an interest in the startup ecosystem is welcome.
