# What is Meet'n'Dine?

[Meet'n'Dine](https://www.notion.so/jjurm/Meet-n-Dine-c0d588aaa93046fe9724599c9ee62976) brings people together to:

- socialise
- feed ourselves
- relax from school and real life
- learn new recipes
- get inspired about how others live their lives
- (optionally) discuss hard questions in life

# Who

The group consists of mostly ETH (or UZH) students, but don't hesitate to reach out if you don't feel like a student and would still like to join.

This community project is set up and currently maintained by our Board member {{< person-inline id="juraj.micko" phone="" >}}.

# Format

Each dinner welcomes around 3 to 8 people in one kitchen. One of us is Masterchef, responsible for preparing the recipe, shopping and feeding the group, others help with the cooking. We'll split the costs of the food individually. Masterchef pays a half share.
