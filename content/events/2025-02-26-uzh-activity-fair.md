Come and support CSSZ at the VSUZH Activity Fair!

This is the right place to learn and ask in person who we are, what we do, how to join us and how to help our efforts.

## VSUZH Activity Fair

Do you have a passion and want to share it with other students? Looking for experiences that complement the knowledge you gained during your studies? The VSUZH Activity Fair is THE fair for student engagement at the University of Zurich.

Here you can meet the people behind the student organisations and initiatives that are active at the University. Immerse yourself in the diversity of student life and find out which organization suits you best!

The next VSUZH Activity Fair will take place on **Wednesday, 26 February 2025** from **09:30** to **16:30** at **Lichthof UZH Center**!

## Free Lunch

From 12:00 to 13:00 there is going to be a **free** foodwaste lunch at Aki and anyone can join. We will be looking forward to seeing you there!
