Join us in exploring the beauty of Ticino, where picturesque lakeside towns meet colourful architecture and Mediterranean flair, and experience the unique blend of Swiss precision and Italian atmosphere. We will start with a walk through the old town of Lugano, followed by a boat ride on the lake. In the lakeside park we will have pizza for lunch and enjoy some ice cream, and those interested will also have the chance to swim in the lake. Then we will decide whether to stay longer in Lugano or continue to Bellinzona, where one can admire the medieval castles listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

## **Connections:**

We will take a train back at 17:17 or 18:17 arriving in Zurich at 18:55 or 19:55, respectively, depending on the situation.

## **Tickets:**

Note that the tickets for trains etc. are not going to be organized collectively. We are going to travel a lot, so it pays off to buy a day pass (Tageskarte). It allows for flexibility and is valid for boats, as well. There is either the Spartageskarte possibly combined with Halbtax, which has to be purchased in advance and whose price grows with time, or the Friends-Tageskarte Jugend, which has a fixed price of 80 Fr. and can be used by up to 4 persons under the age of 25 (max 24,99), i.e. if 4 people share one ticket, each one has to pay 20 Fr. only. You can use the WhatsApp group (see below) to arrange the ticket with others.

## **Communication:**

There is a WhatsApp group for any news & meeting arrangements: [Link to join WhatsApp](https://chat.whatsapp.com/FOfDPDLK9nFCJh96XDCgTd?mode=ems_copy_t)
