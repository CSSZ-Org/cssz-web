## Looking for new team members

If you’re interested in joining our team, we’d love to hear from you. We are looking for new team members to help us organize events and manage the association. We’re looking for new board members, event organisers, and volunteers. If you’re keen to help out, get in touch with us **by September 12**. On September 13, the AGM will take place, at which the new Board and organizational team for the year 2024/2025 will be elected.

Open positions include:

- Board members -- responsible for the overall management of the association (finances, semester planning, venue booking, recruiting new members, etc.)
- Event organisers -- responsible for planning and executing events (pub quizzes, bQm meetups, hikes, dinners, etc. -- your creativity is the limit)
- Volunteers -- forget about the responsibilities and just help us out at specific events
