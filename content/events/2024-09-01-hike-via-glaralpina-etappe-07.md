A more chill hike this time, but still with a good amount of uphill.

## Connection there

06:43 -- 08:52 ([Zürich HB → Urnerboden, Dorf](https://www.sbb.ch/en?date=%222024-09-01%22&moment=%22DEPARTURE%22&selected_trip=0&stops=%5B%7B%22value%22%3A%228503000%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22ID%22%2C%22label%22%3A%22Z%C3%BCrich%20HB%22%7D%2C%7B%22value%22%3A%228505776%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22ID%22%2C%22label%22%3A%22Urnerboden%2C%20Dorf%22%7D%5D&time=%2206%3A42%22))

## Planned route

The route has a minimal variant which can optionally be extended by going closer to the Glattalpsee or even hiking/running around the lake.
Closer to the Glattalpsee, we can split into two groups: one going around the lake while the other one chills and waits for the first group.

**Total distance:** 7.9 km, up to 13.2 km (with the lake loop)  
**Duration:** 5:30 h (minimal), up to 7:10 h (with the lake loop)  
**Uphill/downhill:** 980 m / 500 m  
**Difficulty:** Moderate

## Connection back

depending on our hiking time, for example 17:02 -- 19:55 ([Glattalp → Zürich HB](https://www.sbb.ch/en?date=%222024-09-01%22&moment=%22DEPARTURE%22&selected_trip=0&stops=%5B%7B%22value%22%3A%228530781%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22ID%22%2C%22label%22%3A%22Glattalp%22%7D%2C%7B%22value%22%3A%228503000%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22ID%22%2C%22label%22%3A%22Z%C3%BCrich%20HB%22%7D%5D&time=%2216%3A43%22))

- The first leg is a cable car from Glattalp to Sahli, operated by [Glattalp Luftseilbahn](https://glattalp.ch/).
- The ticket to the cable car (one-way descent) costs CHF 12 and must be bought on the spot (Twint or card)
  - This means, when buying the SBB tickets, only get [Bisisthal, Sahli Seilbahnstat. → Zürich HB](https://www.sbb.ch/en?date=%222024-09-01%22&moment=%22DEPARTURE%22&selected_trip=0&stops=%5B%7B%22value%22%3A%228587691%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22ID%22%2C%22label%22%3A%22Bisisthal%2C%20Sahli%20Seilbahnstat.%22%7D%2C%7B%22value%22%3A%228503000%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22ID%22%2C%22label%22%3A%22Z%C3%BCrich%20HB%22%7D%5D&time=%2216%3A43%22)
- The latest available cable car listed by SBB is at 17:02, but the [Glattalp Fahrplan](https://glattalp.ch/fahrplan/) lists connections until 18:02
