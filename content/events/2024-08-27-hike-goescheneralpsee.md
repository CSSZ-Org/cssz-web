### Cutoff point

The starting and ending point are different, with no road available anywhere in between.
The last bus from Göscheneralp leaves at 17.15, and no later options of public transport are available.
Walking from Göscheneralp to the Göschenen train station would take additional 2:30 hours.

For that reason, we will have a cutoff point at [Voralphütte](https://en.mapy.cz/s/neregemepa) at 11:30.
If someone doesn't reach this point by this time, there is an option to divide the group and some people can return back to the starting point to catch the bus from there.

❗ this is the latest bus!


## Notes

Don't forget to bring enough water and food for the day.
We might not have time to stop for a proper lunch, so bring something to eat on the way.
