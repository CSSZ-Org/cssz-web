Collaboration between [**Cambridge University Czech and Slovak Society (CUCSS)**](https://cucss.uk/) and **Czech and Slovak Students in Zurich (CSSZ)** brings an opportunity for members of the two societies to visit the other city.

Each of the two societies chooses **8 members** to be part of the programme, who will then be paired based on interests. Participants of this programme will host their paired peer (a member of CUCSS) in Zurich for 4 days in exchange to be hosted in Cambridge.

## Goals

1. Presentation of the two cities and universities to members of the other university
2. Establishing tighter connection between CSSZ and CUCSS with the potential of stronger collaboration in the future
3. In case of academic interests of the participants, establishing contacts to members of relevant departments at the target university

## What's offered

If you are among selected participants, you are offered the following:

* Accommodation for 3 nights in a CUCSS member's room in Cambridge (on an inflatable mattress, couch, or a similar low-cost solution)
* Entry to the **Annual Dinner of CUCCS** on 14 May, in the form of a formal dinner at the [Trinity Hall College](https://www.trinhall.cam.ac.uk/), also attended by the Trinity Hall Master [Ms Mary Hockaday
  ](https://www.trinhall.cam.ac.uk/contact-us/contact-directory/fellows-and-academics-directory/mary-hockaday/), who, in the early 1990s, was covering post-communist Czechoslovakia for the BBC in Prague.<br>
    Dress code: smart (black tie optional)<br>
    Included: pre-drinks, 3 courses, wine<br>
    Price: Â£50
* A sightseeing tour of Cambridge and the University
* An in-person meeting with the CUCSS committee

Participants need to arrange their own flights and catering. However, peers from the other university will be happy to help, e.g. agree to cook meals together, give advice on travel, etc.

## What's asked

The programme is an exchange, so we ask the participants to offer a similar package to members of CUCSS, in particular, to accommodate your peer from Cambridge at your place.

## How to apply

If you are interested to participate in this exchange, follow the steps below:

1. Fill in the [Application Form](https://forms.gle/4LBqwbPfhBqG23SE6) by **31 March 2023**.
2. If needed based on the number of applications, coordinators may request you to answer additional questions or join a brief interview.
3. If you are selected, you will be notified via email by **5 April 2023**.

Responsible for picking the participants of the exchange are coordinators of the program in both cities.

Coordinators also reserve the right to change the program details, dates, and what is offered, as might be needed at any time.
