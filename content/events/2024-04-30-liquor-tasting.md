CSSZ invites you to a big food and liquor tasting event.
Members of the association as well as non-members are equally welcome to join.
We'll be tasting a variety of Czech and Slovak liquor specialties, including Slivovice, Boroviƒçka, Becherovka, TATRATEA and more. As a bonus, a selection of Polish alcohol and snacks will be available, too.

This event is organised in collaboration with **ESN Z√ºrich**.  
We expect **80 participants**.


## Entrance fee

- **17 CHF** for ESN Card Holders if registered by **28 April** ‚Äì [register through ESN](https://zurich.esn.ch/event/2946), or
- **20 CHF** for all if registered by **28 April** ‚Äì [register through ESN](https://zurich.esn.ch/event/2946), or
- **23 CHF** if paid at the door by Twint or cash (no change provided).

The entry entitles you to **unlimited** tasting: drink as much as you want. Some snacks will be provided, too.

Due to the nature of the event, only people over 18 years of age are permitted entry.


### ~~Bring liquor, get in for free~~ (no longer available)

**Update:** The last drink collection took place on 23 April. Purchasing a ticket is now the only way to attend the event.

<summary><i>Show the info anyway</i></summary>

We will need a lot of help putting together the alcohol.
If you bring drinks from Czechia or Slovakia, apart from being treated a big hero, you will also get in for free.

1. Purchase traditional wine, beer or soft drinks from Czechia or Slovakia, either in stores or at the airport (for a reasonable price), and _keep the receipt_.

    See the following table for a list of bottles that we are missing, or contact the organisers to coordinate your purchase.

    See [this page](https://www.bazg.admin.ch/bazg/en/home/information-individuals/travel-and-purchases--allowances-and-duty-free-limit/importation-into-switzerland/duty-free-allowances--foodstuffs--alcohol-and-tobacco.html) for the duty-free limits.

2. Please submit [**this form**](https://forms.gle/NYgqJGtc8zMahcJVA) with the list of bottles you are bringing (this will help with planning).
3. Bring the bottles on one of the following days:

   - Wednesday, 17 April between 13:00 and 14:00 next to CAB 55.3 (preferred)
   - **Tuesday, 23 April** between 15:00 and 16:00 next to CAB 55.3 ‚Äì [message Juraj](https://wa.me/+421907240239) when you come
   - (talk to Juraj if you want to arrange a different time)

  We will collect the receipt and reimburse you the full price of the alcohol by Twint.

If you are bringing at least 4 litres of alcohol, you will get in for free. Otherwise, you will get a discount of 5 CHF per delivered litre, which you can apply by purchasing the ticket when delivering the bottles.

You will be put on a guest list, so you don't need to purchase a ticket at the door when you present a photo ID.

## Afterparty

After the official end of the event at 10pm, we will move to a nearby bar or an open space (depending on the weather) for an afterparty.
