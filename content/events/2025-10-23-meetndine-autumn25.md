Plněné knedlíky uzeným se zelím is a traditional Czech dish. It consists of potato dumplings stuffed with smoked meat and served with smoked/cooked cabbage. It is a very popular dish in the Czech Republic / Slovakia and is often served in restaurants and pubs. The dumplings are filled with smoked meat and served on cabbage. The dish is often garnished with parsley and served with a glass of beer. We offer vegetarian alternative as well (smoked tofu), indicate this choice in the form.
