## It’s that time of the year again!!!
On October 23, we will meet in the beautiful kitchen space at UZH (K floor with incredible view over the oldtown and lake) and we’ll be cooking a traditional Czech dish: *Plněné knedlíky uzeným se zelím* (Stuffed dumplings with smoked cabbage). Czech Beer on tap is provided and included in your registration fee.

## What is that dish?
Plněné knedlíky uzeným se zelím is a traditional Czech dish. It consists of potato dumplings stuffed with smoked meat and served with smoked/cooked cabbage. It is a very popular dish in the Czech Republic / Slovakia and is often served in restaurants and pubs. The dumplings are filled with smoked meat and served on cabbage. The dish is often garnished with parsley and served with a glass of beer. We offer vegetarian alternative as well (smoked tofu), indicate this choice in the form.
