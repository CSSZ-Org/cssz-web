| Ever wondered how cold a lake can get in November? Survivable – try for yourself 😉

Join us for an awesome and refreshing morning! We will meet at 9.15 at Katzensee and take a short dip in the lake. Just after the lake we will move to Juraj's place at [Bächlerstrasse 44](https://maps.app.goo.gl/AjQWG4DPyCUNycLUA) to enjoy some protein pancakes and hot tea.  

For those scared a little bit: The dip is not as terrible as it sounds. You can stay for as long as works for you, from just a couple seconds to minutes. If you don't mind being looked down on, you can also just skip the dip waiting us on the shore and join us for the pancakes afterward 😉.
