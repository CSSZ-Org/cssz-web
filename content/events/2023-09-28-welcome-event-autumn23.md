Join us for a lively kick-off to the Autumn semester 2023 at the **bQm** bar 🍻, where the Czech and Slovak Students in Zurich will host a warm welcome event 🌟. This meetup provides an excellent opportunity for both new and existing students to come together, connect, and make friends 🤝. Don't miss this chance to expand your social circle and make lasting memories with fellow students. We look forward to seeing you there! 🎉
