# About

The CSSZ association plans to launch a project targeting high school students through out Czech Republic and Slovakia. \
Experience Zurich is a project inspired by the project of the association of Czech and Slovak Student in Cambridge. The goal of the project is to organise a trip for chosen applicants in second and third year of high school and to make them experience what their future studies at one of the best univirsities might look like. 

# Your time in Zurich

If you get selected to participate in Experience Zurich, you will get a full experience of what awaits you at ETH/UZH. \
Each participant will get a 1on1 mentor - student from CZ/SK, who will spend the time in Zurich with you and provide all necessary information. \
The goal is to match the mentosâ€™s study field to your desired field of your future studies.
You will go to lectures, eat in the local mensa and experience a ETH/UZH study life. You will also get the opportunity to get to know the Czech and Slovak Student community in Zurich. That way, after you move in Zurich, you will already know many people who will be able to help you with not only study related matters.
