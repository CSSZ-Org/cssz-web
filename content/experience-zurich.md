## About

The CSSZ association plans to launch a project targeting high school students throughout the Czech Republic and Slovakia.
The goal of the project is to organise a trip for chosen applicants in second and third year of high school and to make them experience what their future studies at one of the best universities might look like.

Experience Zurich is a project inspired by [The Cambridge University Czech & Slovak Society](http://cucss.uk/), where [a similar program](http://cucss.uk/experience-cambridge-en/) gained success. 

## Your time in Zurich

If you get selected to participate in Experience Zurich, you will get a full experience of what awaits you at ETH/UZH.

Each participant will get a 1-on-1 mentor -- student from CZ/SK, who will spend the time in Zurich with you and provide all necessary information.
The goal is to match the mentor's study field to the interests of the participant.
You will go to lectures, eat in the local mensa and experience the full ETH/UZH study life.
You will also get the opportunity to get to know the Czech and Slovak Student community in Zurich.
That way, after you move in Zurich, you will already know many people who will be able to help you with not only study-related matters.
