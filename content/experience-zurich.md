## About

This project targets Czech and Slovak students interested in studying a Bachelor or Master degree at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html) or [University of Zurich](https://www.uzh.ch/en.html).
The goal of the project is to organise a trip for chosen applicants just before the application deadline of their chosen university, and to make them experience what their future studies at one of the best universities might look like.

Experience Zurich is a project inspired by [The Cambridge University Czech & Slovak Society](https://cucss.uk/), where [a similar program](https://cucss.uk/experience-cambridge) gained success. 

## Your time in Zurich

If you get selected to participate in Experience Zurich, you will get a full experience of what awaits you at ETH/UZH.

Each participant will get a 1-on-1 mentor -- student from CZ/SK, who will spend the time in Zurich with you and provide all necessary information.
The goal is to match the mentor's field of study to the interests of the participant.
You will go to lectures, eat in the local mensa and experience the full ETH/UZH study life.
You will also get the opportunity to get to know the Czech and Slovak Student community in Zurich.
That way, after you move in Zurich, you will already know many people who will be able to help you with not only study-related matters.

You will receive all information needed to successfully apply to ETH or UZH.
We are also ready to answer your questions about any study related matters.
