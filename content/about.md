The CSSZ (Czech and Slovak Students in Zurich) is an association founded by 4 ETH students from Czech Republic and Slovakia. 

Our motivation is to:

1. Unite Czech and Slovak students in Zurich through organising various events
2. Provide help and support for current students
3. Make studying in Zurich more accessible to potential students

We hope you will find the association useful and fun!

Radim, Juraj, Vu, Å imon
