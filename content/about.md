The CSSZ (Czech and Slovak Students in Zurich) is an association founded by 4 ETH students from Czech Republic and Slovakia. 

The association has several goals.

1. To unite the community of students from the Czech Republic and Slovakia in Zurich. This goal is achieved by organizing various social events. 
2. By organizing these for everyone (participation is not limited by nationality, religion or gender), we also want to present Czech and Slovak culture. 
3. To provide support to students not only in academic matters. Students can contact the association with any questions or requests for help. We are also happy to help potential students with their applications and in any other way. 
4. To introduce Swiss culture and studying in Switzerland to the (potential) Czechs and Slovaks. 

The association does not pursue commercial purposes and does not seek profit. The organs work on an honorary basis.
We hope you will find the association useful and fun!
