CSSZ (Czech and Slovak Students in Zurich) is an association founded by 4 ETH students from the Czech Republic and Slovakia. 

## Goals of The Association 

1. **Unite the community** of students from the Czech Republic and Slovakia in Zurich 
2. **Organise events** for everyone to socialize (participation is not limited by nationality, religion or gender), present Czech and Slovak culture. 
3. **Provide support** to students in academic and related matters. Students can contact the association with any questions or requests for help. We are also happy to help potential students with their applications and in any other way.
4. To **introduce Swiss culture** and to the Czechs and Slovaks studying in Switzerland.

The association does not pursue commercial purposes and does not seek profit. The organs work on an honorary basis.
We hope you will find the association useful and fun!
