Dear members,

We would like to wish you all a good start and much strength for the new semester! We would also like to share our plans for events and meetings during this semester â€“ we would be delighted if you could join us at any of them. The very second week of term (Thu 27 Feb) we'll be meeting in the [**bQm bar**]({{< relref `events/2024-02-29-welcome-event-spring24.md`>}}) â€“ come along for a pint, a chat and to meet new and existing students.

Apart from the traditional events, we are planning one new thing this year. Together with **ESN Zurich** we will be hosting a big [Liquor Tasting]({{< relref `events/2024-04-30-liquor-tasting.md` >}}) at the end of April. If you are planning a trip to the Czech Republic/Slovakia and bring some traditional alcohol to the Liquor Tasting, you will get free entry (details on the website).

Other planned events can be found **below**. If you want to know about all the planned events, be sure to subscribe to our calendar. Also, keep an eye on our [instagram](https://instagram.com/cssz.ch/) where we will keep you up to date with the latest news. We hope to see you at some of the events!
