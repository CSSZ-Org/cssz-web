📧 Look no further, we got you covered using our new [room-seekers@cssz.ch](mailto:room-seekers@cssz.ch) mailing list. 🥳

## Looking for a room

{{< button label="Join the group" link="https://groups.google.com/a/cssz.ch/g/room-seekers" class="btn-primary" >}} to receive emails for any potential offers.
You can always leave or manage your membership through [Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/).
When responding to an offer, make sure you read the listing in detail -- unrelated responses are a huge factor for a low response rate.

Of course, make sure to also use other ways to look for a room, such as [WG Zimmer](https://www.wgzimmer.ch/) or [Woko](https://www.woko.ch/).

## Looking for a flatmate

{{< button label="Email the group" link="mailto:room-seekers@cssz.ch?subject=Room%20available%20in%3A%20&body=Address%3A%0D%0AFrom%3A%0D%0AUntil%3A%0D%0APrice%20per%20month%3A%0D%0ANotes%3A%0D%0A%0D%0ALink%20to%20the%20original%20ad%2C%20including%20a%20full%20description%2C%20all%20details%2C%20and%20pictures%3A%0D%0A" class="btn-primary" >}}
with anything you've got, you don't need to join the group youself.
The best is if you have a link to your already existing ad (such as on [WG Zimmer](https://www.wgzimmer.ch/)) that has more information about the room (address, size, price, pictures, description of flatmates, and so on).

You will hear back if any of the candidates are interested.
