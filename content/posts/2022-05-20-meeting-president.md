On 20 May 2022, the Board of CSSZ was delighted to meet the **President of Slovakia, H.E. Zuzana Čaputová**.
She visited ETH Zurich as part of her three-day visit to Switzerland.
Hosted by the H.E. Ignazio Cassis, President of the Swiss Confederation, she was introduced to the co-working space Student Project House and a few specific projects. One of the presenters was also Matúš Žilinec (matus.zilinec@cssz.ch).

After the visit, the delegation went to the famous Polyterrasse in front of the main building of ETH, where students from Slovakia and the Czech Republic exchanged a few words directly with the President Čaputová. We talked about studying at ETH and the CSSZ association. The President was grateful for the meeting, and she appreciated our initiative.

Thank you to the President for a very nice meeting!
