Hey all,

We wish you a great start to the new semester! We have a lot of exciting events planned for you this semester. We would be delighted if you joined us at any of them. More details are coming later at the beginning of the semester. You can find a rough outline below. Make sure to [sign up for our newsletter](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeo2aFQFMGMKH2_5Mt2Kh2Z8TsMb0cf2ykdRiKz9vMHPpgHMQ/viewform) to stay in the loop. 

This year the **AGM will take place online on September 12**. We will be electing the new board and organizing team. If you want to participate, sign up [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf4cSVzluHUELZy2cXoQJNROBzs9AqJAAFjoQyPVmFxeRMftw/viewform?usp=sf_link). Shortly after, we will also publish the specific planned events for the next semester.

And if you‚Äôre interested in joining our team, we‚Äôd love to hear from you - more below!


## Events

We‚Äôre kicking things off with a Welcome Event at a cool local spot ‚Äì great chance to meet everyone. Then, we‚Äôll head outdoors for a Hike to enjoy some fresh air and good views. Mid-October, we‚Äôll get together for a laid-back Meet ‚Äòn‚Äô Dine. In November, there‚Äôs another hangout over food at Mensa UZH. As winter hits, we plan to organize a Ski Day Trip in December, and later in February, there‚Äôs a bigger Ski Trip to close out the season. Can't wait to see you there.

If you want to know about all the planned events, be sure to subscribe to our calendar. Also, keep an eye on our [instagram](https://instagram.com/cssz.ch/) where we will keep you up to date with the latest news. We hope to see you at some of the events!

## Looking for new team members

We are looking for new team members to help us organize events and manage the association. We‚Äôre looking for new board members, event organisers, and volunteers. Get in touch with us if you‚Äôre keen to help out. On September 13, the Annual General Assembly will take place, at which the new Board and organizational team for the year 2024/2025 will be elected.

Open positions include:

- Board member -- responsible for the overall management of the association (finances, semester planning, venue booking, recruiting new members, etc.)
- Event organiser -- responsible for planning and executing events (pub quizzes, bQm meetups, hikes, dinners, etc. -- your creativity is the limit)
- Volunteer -- forget about the responsibilities and just help us out at specific events

If you are interested in directly participating in the running of the association and being part of the Board / Organizing committee, please **apply by September 12th** using the mail link below.
