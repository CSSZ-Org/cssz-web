Zuzana ÄŒaputovÃ¡&lt;/strong&gt;.
She visited ETH Zurich as part of her three-day visit to Switzerland.
Hosted by the H.E. Ignazio Cassis, President of the Swiss Confederation, she was introduced to the co-working space Student Project House and a few specific projects. One of the presenters was also MatÃºÅ¡ Å½ilinec (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;mailto:matus.zilinec@cssz.ch&#34; &gt;matus.zilinec@cssz.ch&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the visit, the delegation went to the famous Polyterrasse in front of the main building of ETH, where students from Slovakia and the Czech Republic exchanged a few words directly with the President ÄŒaputovÃ¡. We talked about studying at ETH and the CSSZ association. The President was grateful for the meeting, and she appreciated our initiative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you to the President for a very nice meeting!&lt;/p&gt;
